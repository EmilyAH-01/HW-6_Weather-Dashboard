# weather-dashboard

## Summary 
This webpage accepts a city name as input in a search field, stores the city name in local storage, then displays both current weather data and five-day forecast data for the city. Stored city names are displayed as buttons under the search field; once clicked, weather data for that city is displayed again.

Weather data is retrieved from the openweathermap.org APIs using AJAX and HTTP GET requests .
